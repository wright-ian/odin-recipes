            with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Lower the chicken onto the beer cah so the chicken is sitting upright with the can inside.</li>
        <li>Place the chicken on the cool side of the grill. Use the legs and beer can as a tripod to support the

        <li>Transfer the chicken to a tray and let rest for 10 minutes. Be careful when removing the can as it will
            still be hot, and full.
